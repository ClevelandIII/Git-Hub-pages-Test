        <h1> Quick Hummus Recipe </h1>

        <p> This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. </p>

        <p> Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads. </p>

        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> 1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans) </li>
            <li> 175g of tahini </li>
            <li> 6 sundried tomatoes </li>
            <li> Half a red pepper </li>
            <li> A pinch of cayenne pepper </li>
            <li> 1 clove of garlic </li>
            <li> A dash of olive oil </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Instruction </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely </li>
            <li> Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely </li>
            <li> Add all the ingredients into a food processor </li>
            <li> Process all the ingredients into a paste </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li> If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time </li>
            <li> If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Sorry about the weird formatting on the lists, I figured it would look better centered than not -->

        <p> For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you. </p>

        <h3>Storage</h3>

        <p> Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. </p>

        <p> Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months. </p>
